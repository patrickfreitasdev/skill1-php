This code was created for Skill assessment of Programming Essentials NIT using PHP.

Case scenario:

Maddington Library is a client of Superfast IT, and recently Michael Gibbs, the manager of Maddington Library, has contacted me for a software development project.

Maddington Library wants to develop a CLI-based simple library management project to digitalise Library Storage management. They have provided a user requirement document which I am attaching to this email.

I have set up your meeting with Michael Gibbs for next Tuesday. Before the meeting, please review the user requirement document. In the meeting, please interview Michael about his business needs and complete the client questionnaire.

Once all the information on the client questionnaire is completed, develop the software as per SuperFast ITâ€™s standards.
